      "value": "<p>Likely to be one of the most highly prized ingredients in the world, saffron is so expensive because it is so labor-intensive to produce. Made from the Crocus sativus, or more commonly the \"saffron crocus\", it takes 80,000 crocus flowers to produce 1 pound of saffron.By weight, it is worth more than gold. Treasured by the most discerning of cooks and apothecaries for its flavoring and purported health benefits.</p>",
